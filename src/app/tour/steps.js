          VEX Rewards enable the community-powered nature of betVEX. With VEX

          generates and decide how the platform changes in the future. 70% of
          the revenue betVEX generates is distributed to those who have
          activated their VEX Rewards. The other 30% is sent to the treasury for
          the community to collectively spend.

          <h2>How to activate VEX Rewards</h2>
          <p>
            By activating VEX Rewards, you provide funds to back platform bets.
            70% of all betting revenue is distributed proportionally to VEX
            Rewards activatorsâ€”the more you activate, the more you earn. You can
            increase your activation anytime.
            <br />
            In rare cases, betting markets may cause losses to activated
            rewards, though we expect a 5% return per market. When you&apos;re
            done collecting rewards, you can deactivate to stop earning and
            eliminate loss risk. Note: Deactivation is only possible 1 week
            after your last activation to ensure activators properly back bets.
